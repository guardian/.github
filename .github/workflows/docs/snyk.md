# Snyk

We used to have two Snyk workflows: [sbt-node-snyk](https://github.com/guardian/.github/blob/33dd5438acf3d2446dda9b6e12f0fd6ffc78f794/.github/workflows/sbt-node-snyk.yml) and [sbt-node-snyk-pr](https://github.com/guardian/.github/blob/33dd5438acf3d2446dda9b6e12f0fd6ffc78f794/.github/workflows/sbt-node-snyk-pr.yml).

But our contract with Snyk has now ended so these workflows have been deprecated in favour of [Dependabot Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts).
