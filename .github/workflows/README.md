# Reusable Workflows
This directory contains [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) for the `guardian` GitHub organisation. 
Instructions for using each of them can be found in the [docs](./docs) folder.

_N.B. Reusable workflows must be defined at the top level of the `.github/workflows` directory, so related workflows
are recommended to be namespaced using prefixes rather than subdirectories._
