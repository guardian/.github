**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Welcome to the Guardian Github organisation. The Guardian is the UK's [most widely used newspaper website](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/28/the-guardian-most-widely-used-newspaper-website-and-app-for-news-according-to-ofcom), with over 6 million unique daily users. Thanks to its [unique ownership structure](https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust), the Guardian remains one of the UK's only independent media organisations.

At the Guardian we seek to [develop in the open](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/nov/28/developing-in-the-open) whenever possible, so you'll find a *lot* of code here. Some repositories of note include:

 - [Frontend](https://github.com/guardian/frontend) and [dotcom-rendering](https://github.com/guardian/dotcom-rendering) - the magic behind theguardian.com
 - [Grid](https://github.com/guardian/grid/) - the Guardian's open source picture system, also used by the BBC.
 - [Giant](https://github.com/guardian/giant) - a tool to make it easier for journalists to search, analyse, categorise and share unstructured data
